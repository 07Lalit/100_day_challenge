# What is data ?
=> Data are raw fact's and figures (unprocessed)

# What is Structure?
=> It is a way of organizing .

# Algorithms ?
=> It is a step-by-step procedure to solve any problem .

# data structure ?
=> Something which store data .
   like list, int , tuple, string , boolean , complex .

=> Data Structure is a way of storing and organizing data
  in computer memory in such a way we can use them , able to
  apply operation on them in more convenient(easy not complex) and
  efficient (less resource consumed) them .

Type of data structure:
1) Primitive data structure : Inbuilt in programming language .
                        int , string ,bool , complex,float ,double
2) Non-primitive data structure : they are defined by programmers classify into
                        two types :
        2.1) Linear
       -> Array
       -> Stack
       -> Queue
       -> Linkedlist

       2.2) Non-linear
       -> Tree
       -> Graph

# Linear Data Structure : The elements/data stored in this data structure are
                      connected in a sequence manner by mean of logically or
                      in sequence memory location .

        array : sequential and continuous
        linkedlist : sequential but not continuous

        Every continuous ds is also sequential data structure.

# Non-linear DS : data is not arranged in sequential manner .
                they are arranged in hierarchical manner .
                ex : tree and graph

1) intro to ds
2) recursion
3) Time and space complexity
4) list
5) string
6) searching
7) sorting  6 type
8) linkedlist
9) stack
10) Queue-> singly ,circular, doubly,
11) heap
12) Tree -> binary tree, binary search tree, AVl , red -black tree , spanning tree ,segemnt tree .
13) Graph -> bfs , dfs , theory , connected component , adjacency matrix , list rep.
14) Huffman coding
15) divide and conquer
16) Greedy
17) DP
18)game theory
19) prisms
19) kruskal
20) dijkastra algorithm
21) Bellman-ford
22) mathematics , probability, statics
