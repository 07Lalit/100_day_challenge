                 Recursion
                 ---------

=> Programming technique in which a function call inside it's body
   repeatedly with a specific condition reached
-> this used to solve bigger complex problem
-> time-consuming .

 loops or recursion -> fibbonaci , factorial
 only recursion ->  iterative way is not applicable
 -> tower of Hanoi
 -> josephous problem
 -> permutation

 application -> Dynamic programming , divide and conquer , TOH , DFS traversal
               Tree .

ex :

    def fun():

        fun()   #recursive function call it's inside it's body
